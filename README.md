## Dataset

The PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment ) is an internationally standardized assessment administered to 15-year-olds by OECD every 3 years to know how well education systems prepare students for real-life situations. The results of the PISA test are then used for policy making purposes to improve the quality of education.
In 2012, 510 000 students from 65 countries/economies(both member and partner states) took part in the assessment. The test covered reading, mathematics, science, financial literacy and problem-solving skills with a major focus on mathematical literacy. In addition to the technical topics, students also responded to a background questionnaire as part of the assessment.

The source of the dataset was the 2012 PISA survey results. Since the data provided by OECD was already well prepared, no data wrangling was performed. 



## Summary of Findings

A summary of the findings drawn from the data are provided below:
1. Cellphones, televisions, computers, internet, own rooms and desks are present in most of the households. However, it also seems that most households have 1 car and share 1 bathroom. 
2. Books seem to be in all households and most have 26 to 100 books which does not include magazines, newspapers or school books, text books and dictionaries. However, educational software, poetry, art and literature are less popular.
3. Most students scored between 400 and 500 in Mathematics and between 450 and 550 in Science and Reading. Most students also intend to pursue a career in Science rather than a career in Mathematics.
4. China-Shanghai is the top Country for all subjects; Singapore and Hong Kong- China are among the top 5 in all subjects; Japan and Finland are among the top 5 countries in Reading and Science but not Maths; and Chinese Taipei and Korea are in the top 5 countries in Mathematics but not Reading and Science
5. The most popular learning strategies in the top performing countries are; figuring out the most important parts to learn, trying to improve understanding of mathematical concepts, setting learning goals and reiterating through examples.
6. Female students scored high in Reading and Science while male students scored high in Mathematics.
7. There appears to be a positive correlation between all the variable. High Scores in one subject correlates to the scores in another.
8. Students with the highest number of books from 101 upwards also scored high in reading while students with 10 or less books got the lowest scores
9. Students with three or more computers got the highest scores, while students with no computers and no bathrooms got the lowest scores. The number of cars in a household does not significantly influence a student's preference for either career of their overall achievement.
10. Students score higher in reading when they have dictionaries and literature. Technical reference books and poetry do not do not have a significant effect on reading scores.
11. Native Students tend to score high in Math but prefer a career in Science rather than Math while students who are first generation immigrants got the lowest math scores and have the lowest intention of pursuing a career in Math.


## Key Insights for Presentation

1. A student's socioeconomic status has a great effect on their performance. Students of a lower socioeconomic status  score significantly lower than their counterparts. 
2. China-Shanghai is the top Country for all subjects; Singapore and Hong Kong- China are among the top 5 in all subjects; Japan and Finland are among the top 5 countries in Reading and Science but not Maths; and Chinese Taipei and Korea are in the top 5 countries in Mathematics but not Reading and Science
3. It appears that a career in Science is more popular. Students in Finland have the highest preference for careers in mathematics even if they do not rank among the first 5 countries in Math Scores, while students from Hong Kong China and  China Shanghai scored high in Math but are not very interested in pursuing a career in Math.
